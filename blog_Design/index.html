		<h1>Is the future in the <em>past?</em></h1>
		<small>What happens when the old-timers retire</small>

		<p>
			Just this week, I was talking to one of the old friends my father had during high-school. 
			Interestingly enough, it turned out that he was a mainframe engineer in IBM, working primarily in an administrative function.
			However, the interesting thing about him wasn't what he did, but rather how he got there.

			Carlos, the DBA/Maingrame virtuoso, got his start repairing critical errors in production databses, quicker and cleaner than anyone around.
			Bit of an understatement to say he was special.
			After a while working on emergency projects, he was hired by IBM as a project manager.
			Finally, he was in a more stable position.
